### Hello, I'm Owen!
I'm a Game Developer studying in the Netherlands. When I'm not making games, I love to play them, but also enjoy reading books, watching anime, and creating mods for games I enjoy playing.
I'm a serious worker who's always striving to write the most readable and effective code possible, and also have experience with Blender and Paint.NET to create my own models, textures and animations.

At this moment, I'm searching for internship opportunities to further develop my skills and discover more about what I can provide to the Game Development industry.
